Examine some of the principal objections which have been made to Creeds by their adversaries.</a>
<ul>
<li class="chapter" data-level="1.2.1" data-path="01-creeds-and-confessions.html"><a href="01-creeds-and-confessions.html#and-the-first-which-i-shall-mention-is-that-forming-a-creedand-requiring-subscription-to-it-as-a-religious-test-is-superseding-the-bible-and-making-a-human-composition-instead-of-it-a-standard-of-faith.-the-bible-say-those-who-urge-this-objection-is-the-only-infallible-rule-of-faith-and-practice.-it-is-so-complete-that-it-needs-no-human-addition-and-so-easily-understood-that-it-requires-no-human-explanation.-why-then-should-we-desire-any-other-ecclesiastical-standard-why-subscribe-ourselves-or-call-upon-others-to-subscribe-any-other-creed-than-this-plain-inspired-and-perfect-one-every-time-we-do-this-we-offer-a-public-indignity-to-the-sacred-volume-as-we-virtually-declare-either-that-it-is-not-infallible-or-not-sufficient."><i class="fa fa-check"></i><b>1.2.1</b> 1. And the first which I shall mention is, that forming a Creed,and requiring subscription to it as a religious test, is superseding the Bible, and making a human composition instead of it a standard of faith. “The Bible,” say those who urge this objection, “is the only infallible rule of faith and practice. It is so complete, that it needs no human addition, and so easily understood, that it requires no human explanation. Why, then, should we desire any other ecclesiastical standard? Why subscribe ourselves, or call upon others to subscribe, any other Creed than this plain, inspired, and perfect one? Every time we do this we offer a public indignity to the sacred volume, as we virtually declare, either that it is not infallible, or not sufficient.”</a></li>
<li class="chapter" data-level="1.2.2" data-path="01-creeds-and-confessions.html"><a href="01-creeds-and-confessions.html#another-objection-frequently-made-to-church-creeds-is-that-they-interfere-with-the-rights-of-conscience-and-naturally-lead-to-oppression.-what-right-say-those-who-urge-this-objection-has-any-church-or-body-of-churches-to-impose-a-creed-on-me-or-dictate-to-me-what-i-shall-believe-to-attempt-such-dictation-is-tyranny-to-submit-to-it-is-to-surrender-the-right-of-private-judgment."><i class="fa fa-check"></i><b>1.2.2</b> 2. Another objection frequently made to church Creeds is, that they interfere with the rights of conscience, and naturally lead to oppression. “What right,” say those who urge this objection, “has any church, or body of churches, to impose a Creed on me, or dictate to me what I shall believe? To attempt such dictation is tyranny; to submit to it, is to surrender the right of private judgment.”</a></li>
<li class="chapter" data-level="1.2.3" data-path="01-creeds-and-confessions.html"><a href="01-creeds-and-confessions.html#a-third-objection-often-urged-against-subscription-to-creeds-and-confessions-isthat-it-is-unfriendly-to-free-inquiry.-when-a-man-say-the-enemies-of-creeds-has-once-subscribed-a-public-formulary-and-taken-his-ecclesiastical-stand-with-a-church-which-requires-it-he-must-continue-so-to-believe-to-the-end-of-life-or-resign-his-place-new-light-in-abundance-may-offer-itself-to-his-view-but-he-must-close-his-eyes-against-it.-now-can-it-be-right-say-they-for-any-one-voluntarily-to-place-himself-in-circumstances-of-so-much-temptation-willingly-to-place-himself-within-the-reach-of-strong-inducements-to-tamper-with-conscience-and-to-resist-conviction"><i class="fa fa-check"></i><b>1.2.3</b> 3. A third objection often urged against subscription to Creeds and Confessions is,that it is unfriendly to free inquiry. “When a man,” say the enemies of Creeds, “has once subscribed a public formulary, and taken his ecclesiastical stand with a church which requires it, he must continue so to believe to the end of life or resign his place; new light in abundance may offer itself to his view; but he must close his eyes against it. Now, can it be right,” say they, “for any one voluntarily to place himself in circumstances of so much temptation; willingly to place himself within the reach of strong inducements to tamper with conscience, and to resist conviction?”</a></li>
<li class="chapter" data-level="1.2.4" data-path="01-creeds-and-confessions.html"><a href="01-creeds-and-confessions.html#a-fourth-objection-frequently-brought-against-creeds-is-that-they-have-altogether-failed-of-answering-the-purpose-professed-to-be-intended-by-them.-churches-it-is-said-which-have-creeds-the-most-carefully-drawn-and-of-the-most-rigid-character-are-as-far-from-being-united-in-doctrinal-opinions-as-some-which-either-have-never-had-any-creeds-at-all-or-have-long-since-professedly-omitted-to-enforce-subscription-to-them.-to-mention-only-two-examples-the-church-of-england-for-nearly-three-centuries-has-had-a-set-of-articles-decisively-calvinistic-to-which-all-her-candidates-for-the-ministry-are-required-to-subscribe-but-we-know-that-more-than-a-hundred-and-fifty-years-have-passed-away-since-pelagian-and-semi-pelagian-tenets-began-to-pollute-that-important-branch-of-the-reformed-church-and-that-within-the-last-seventy-five-or-eighty-years-almost-every-form-of-heresy-has-lurked-under-subscription-to-her-orthodox-articles.-and-even-the-church-of-scotland-which-has-had-for-nearly-two-centuries-the-most-rigidly-and-minutely-orthodox-confession-on-earth-is-generally-supposed-at-this-hour-to-have-a-ministry-far-from-being-unanimous-in-loving-and-honouring-her-public-standards.-now-if-creeds-have-not-in-fact-been-productive-of-the-great-benefit-intended-by-them-even-in-some-of-the-most-favourable-cases-that-can-be-produced-why-be-perplexed-and-burdened-with-them-at-all"><i class="fa fa-check"></i><b>1.2.4</b> 4. A fourth objection frequently brought against Creeds is, that they have altogether failed of answering the purpose professed to be intended by them. “Churches,” it is said, which have Creeds the most carefully drawn, and of the most rigid character, are as far from being united in doctrinal opinions, as some which either have never had any Creeds at all, or have long since professedly omitted to enforce subscription to them. To mention only two examples: the Church of England, for nearly three centuries, has had a set of Articles decisively Calvinistic, to which all her candidates for the ministry are required to subscribe; but we know that more than a hundred and fifty years have passed away, since Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian tenets began to pollute that important branch of the reformed Church; and that within the last seventy-five or eighty years, almost every form of heresy has lurked under subscription to her orthodox Articles. And even the Church of Scotland, which has had, for nearly two centuries, the most rigidly and minutely orthodox Confession on earth, is generally supposed, at this hour, to have a ministry far from being unanimous in loving and honouring her public standards. Now, if Creeds have not in fact, been productive of the great benefit intended by them, even in some of the most favourable cases that can be produced, why be perplexed and burdened with them at all?"</a></li>
<li class="chapter" data-level="1.2.5" data-path="01-creeds-and-confessions.html"><a href="01-creeds-and-confessions.html#the-last-objection-which-i-shall-consider-is-that-subscription-to-creeds-has-not-only-failed-entirely-of-producing-the-benefits-con-templated-by-their-friends-but-has-rather-been-found-to-produce-the-opposite-evilsto-generate-discord-and-strife.-creeds-say-some-instead-of-tending-to-compose-differences-and-to-bind-the-members-of-churches-more-closely-together-have-rather-proved-a-bone-of-contention-and-a-means-of-exciting-mutual-charges-of-heresy-and-a-thousand-ill-feelings-among-those-who-might-have-been-otherwise-perfectly-harmonious."><i class="fa fa-check"></i><b>1.2.5</b> 5. The last objection which I shall consider is, that subscription to Creeds, has not only failed entirely of producing the benefits con templated by their friends; but has rather been found to produce the opposite evils;—to generate discord and strife. “Creeds,” say some, “instead of tending to compose differences, and to bind the members of churches more closely together, have rather proved a bone of contention, and a means of exciting mutual charges of heresy, and a thousand ill feelings, among those who might have been otherwise perfectly harmonious.”</a></li>
<li class="chapter" data-level="1.2.6" data-path="01-creeds-and-confessions.html"><a href="01-creeds-and-confessions.html#from-the-representation-which-has-been"><i class="fa fa-check"></i><b>1.2.6</b> 1. From the representation which has been</a></li>

Once more; if the foregoing principles be just, then how unhappy is the mistake of those who imagine, that by abandoning all Creeds and Confessions, they are about to render the Church an essential service; to build her up more extensively and gloriously than ever! There are those who imagine that a new order of things is about to open on the Church, amounting to as great a change of dispensation as ever marked the progress of the Redeemer’s kingdom, in any preceding age. In this new and undefined prospect, they seem to themselves to see the approaching prostration of most of those fences, and the dissolution of most of those ties, which have heretofore been regarded as indispensable to the maintenance of unity and harmony in the family of Christ. I shall only say, that it will be time enough to provide for this new order of things when it shall arrive; and that, in the mean while, in the present state of the world, I should as soon think of extending and edifying the Church, by laying aside all the means of grace; as of promoting its purity and peace, by abandoning those methods of binding its members together, which have been found necessary ever since the days of the Apostles.</a></li>

<!--- make it so en dashes never break, ORIGINAL script using .nobreak CSS span::: problem: breaks popup functionality of refTagger, even though the RegEx avoids messing with any refTagger refs; problem is with the script targeting any element which includes the refTagger, even if the RegEx avoids doing anything to the refTagger link HTML itself. It does not seem possible to use selectors to select everything but avoid selecting <a> tags with class "rtBibleRef". Problem is that if you select the <p> which has the link in it, you can't avoid selecting the <a> inside it. Script doesn't break reftagger if it is loaded on document.ready. Solution seems to be to find a way to use document.ready and somehow avoid Scripture ref en dashes. Maybe borrow reftagger's bible book regex, but that seems hopeless, esp. since I don't believe there's general browser support for negative lookbehind RegEx...
