the-utility-and-importance-of-creeds-and-confessions-adressed-particularly-to-candidates-for-the-ministry
i.
without-a-creed-explicitly-adopted-it-is-not-easy-to-see-how-the-ministers-and-members-of-any-particular-church-and-more-especially-a-large-denomination-of-christians-can-maintain-unity-among-themselves.
the-necessity-and-importance-of-creeds-and-confessions-appear-from-the-consideration-that-one-great-design-of-establishing-a-church-in-our-world-was-that-she-might-be-in-all-ages-a-depository-a-guardian-and-a-witness-of-the-truth.
the-adoption-and-publication-of-a-creed-is-a-tribute-to-truth-and-candour-which-every-christian-church-owes-to-the-other-churches-and-to-the-world-around-her.
another-argument-in-favour-of-creeds-publicly-adopted-and-maintained-is-that-they-are-friendly-to-the-study-of-christian-doctrine-and-of-course-to-the-prevalence-of-christian-knowledge.
it-is-an-argument-of-no-small-weight-in-favour-of-creeds-that-the-experience-of-all-ages-has-found-them-indispensably-necessary.
a-further-argument-in-favour-of-creeds-and-confessions-may-be-drawn-from-the-remarkable-fact-that-their-most-zealous-opposers-have-generally-been-latitudinarians-and-heretics.
the-only-further-argument-in-support-of-creeds-on-which-i-shall-dwell-is-that-their-most-zealous-opposers-do-themselves-virtually-employ-them-in-all-ecclesiastical-proceedings.
ii.-examine-some-of-the-principal-objections-which-have-been-made-to-creeds-by-their-adversaries.
and-the-first-which-i-shall-mention-is-that-forming-a-creedand-requiring-subscription-to-it-as-a-religious-test-is-superseding-the-bible-and-making-a-human-composition-instead-of-it-a-standard-of-faith.-the-bible-say-those-who-urge-this-objection-is-the-only-infallible-rule-of-faith-and-practice.-it-is-so-complete-that-it-needs-no-human-addition-and-so-easily-understood-that-it-requires-no-human-explanation.-why-then-should-we-desire-any-other-ecclesiastical-standard-why-subscribe-ourselves-or-call-upon-others-to-subscribe-any-other-creed-than-this-plain-inspired-and-perfect-one-every-time-we-do-this-we-offer-a-public-indignity-to-the-sacred-volume-as-we-virtually-declare-either-that-it-is-not-infallible-or-not-sufficient.
another-objection-frequently-made-to-church-creeds-is-that-they-interfere-with-the-rights-of-conscience-and-naturally-lead-to-oppression.-what-right-say-those-who-urge-this-objection-has-any-church-or-body-of-churches-to-impose-a-creed-on-me-or-dictate-to-me-what-i-shall-believe-to-attempt-such-dictation-is-tyranny-to-submit-to-it-is-to-surrender-the-right-of-private-judgment.
a-third-objection-often-urged-against-subscription-to-creeds-and-confessions-isthat-it-is-unfriendly-to-free-inquiry.-when-a-man-say-the-enemies-of-creeds-has-once-subscribed-a-public-formulary-and-taken-his-ecclesiastical-stand-with-a-church-which-requires-it-he-must-continue-so-to-believe-to-the-end-of-life-or-resign-his-place-new-light-in-abundance-may-offer-itself-to-his-view-but-he-must-close-his-eyes-against-it.-now-can-it-be-right-say-they-for-any-one-voluntarily-to-place-himself-in-circumstances-of-so-much-temptation-willingly-to-place-himself-within-the-reach-of-strong-inducements-to-tamper-with-conscience-and-to-resist-conviction
a-fourth-objection-frequently-brought-against-creeds-is-that-they-have-altogether-failed-of-answering-the-purpose-professed-to-be-intended-by-them.-churches-it-is-said-which-have-creeds-the-most-carefully-drawn-and-of-the-most-rigid-character-are-as-far-from-being-united-in-doctrinal-opinions-as-some-which-either-have-never-had-any-creeds-at-all-or-have-long-since-professedly-omitted-to-enforce-subscription-to-them.-to-mention-only-two-examples-the-church-of-england-for-nearly-three-centuries-has-had-a-set-of-articles-decisively-calvinistic-to-which-all-her-candidates-for-the-ministry-are-required-to-subscribe-but-we-know-that-more-than-a-hundred-and-fifty-years-have-passed-away-since-pelagian-and-semi-pelagian-tenets-began-to-pollute-that-important-branch-of-the-reformed-church-and-that-within-the-last-seventy-five-or-eighty-years-almost-every-form-of-heresy-has-lurked-under-subscription-to-her-orthodox-articles.-and-even-the-church-of-scotland-which-has-had-for-nearly-two-centuries-the-most-rigidly-and-minutely-orthodox-confession-on-earth-is-generally-supposed-at-this-hour-to-have-a-ministry-far-from-being-unanimous-in-loving-and-honouring-her-public-standards.-now-if-creeds-have-not-in-fact-been-productive-of-the-great-benefit-intended-by-them-even-in-some-of-the-most-favourable-cases-that-can-be-produced-why-be-perplexed-and-burdened-with-them-at-all
the-last-objection-which-i-shall-consider-is-that-subscription-to-creeds-has-not-only-failed-entirely-of-producing-the-benefits-con-templated-by-their-friends-but-has-rather-been-found-to-produce-the-opposite-evilsto-generate-discord-and-strife.-creeds-say-some-instead-of-tending-to-compose-differences-and-to-bind-the-members-of-churches-more-closely-together-have-rather-proved-a-bone-of-contention-and-a-means-of-exciting-mutual-charges-of-heresy-and-a-thousand-ill-feelings-among-those-who-might-have-been-otherwise-perfectly-harmonious.
