without-a-creed-explicitly-adopted-it-is-not-easy-to-see-how-the-ministers-and-members-of-any-particular-church-and-more-especially-a-large-denomination-of-christians-can-maintain-unity-among-themselves.
the-necessity-and-importance-of-creeds-and-confessions-appear-from-the-consideration-that-one-great-design-of-establishing-a-church-in-our-world-was-that-she-might-be-in-all-ages-a-depository-a-guardian-and-a-witness-of-the-truth.
the-adoption-and-publication-of-a-creed-is-a-tribute-to-truth-and-candour-which-every-christian-church-owes-to-the-other-churches-and-to-the-world-around-her.
another-argument-in-favour-of-creeds-publicly-adopted-and-maintained-is-that-they-are-friendly-to-the-study-of-christian-doctrine-and-of-course-to-the-prevalence-of-christian-knowledge.
it-is-an-argument-of-no-small-weight-in-favour-of-creeds-that-the-experience-of-all-ages-has-found-them-indispensably-necessary.
the-only-further-argument-in-support-of-creeds-on-which-i-shall-dwell-is-that-their-most-zealous-opposers-do-themselves-virtually-employ-them-in-all-ecclesiastical-proceedings.
