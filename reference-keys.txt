without-a-creed-explicitly-adopted-it-is-not-easy-to-see-how-the-ministers-and-members-of-any-particular-church-and-more-especially-a-large-denomination-of-christians-can-maintain-unity-among-themselves.
the-necessity-and-importance-of-creeds-and-confessions-appear-from-the-consideration-that-one-great-design-of-establishing-a-church-in-our-world-was-that-she-might-be-in-all-ages-a-depository-a-guardian-and-a-witness-of-the-truth.
the-adoption-and-publication-of-a-creed-is-a-tribute-to-truth-and-candour-which-every-christian-church-owes-to-the-other-churches-and-to-the-world-around-her.
another-argument-in-favour-of-creeds-publicly-adopted-and-maintained-is-that-they-are-friendly-to-the-study-of-christian-doctrine-and-of-course-to-the-prevalence-of-christian-knowledge.
it-is-an-argument-of-no-small-weight-in-favour-of-creeds-that-the-experience-of-all-ages-has-found-them-indispensably-necessary.
a-further-argument-in-favour-of-creeds-and-confessions-may-be-drawn-from-the-remarkable-fact-that-their-most-zealous-opposers-have-generally-been-latitudinarians-and-heretics.
the-only-further-argument-in-support-of-creeds-on-which-i-shall-dwell-is-that-their-most-zealous-opposers-do-themselves-virtually-employ-them-in-all-ecclesiastical-proceedings.

and-the-first-which-i-shall-mention-is-that-forming-a-creedand-requiring-subscription-to-it-as-a-religious-test-is-superseding-the-bible-and-making-a-human-composition-instead-of-it-a-standard-of-faith.
another-objection-frequently-made-to-church-creeds-isthat-they-interfere-with-the-rights-ofconscienceand-naturally-lead-to-op-pression.-w-h-a-t-right-say-those-w-h-o-urge
a-third-objection-often-urged-against-subscription-to-creeds-and-confessions-isthat-it-is-unfriendly-to-free-inquiry.
a-fourth-objection-frequently-brought
the-last-objection-which-i-shall-consider-is-that-subscription-to-creeds-has-not-only-failed-entirely-of-producing-the-benefits-con-templated-by-their-friends-but-has-rather-been-found-to-produce-the-opposite-evilsto-generate-discord-and-strife.
