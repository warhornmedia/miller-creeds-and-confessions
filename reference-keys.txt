the-utility-and-importance-of-creeds-and-confessions-adressed-particularly-to-candidates-for-the-ministry
i.
without-a-creed-explicitly-adopted-it-is-not-easy-to-see-how-the-ministers-and-members-of-any-particular-church-and-more-especially-a-large-denomination-of-christians-can-maintain-unity-among-themselves.
the-necessity-and-importance-of-creeds-and-confessions-appear-from-the-consideration-that-one-great-design-of-establishing-a-church-in-our-world-was-that-she-might-be-in-all-ages-a-depository-a-guardian-and-a-witness-of-the-truth.
the-adoption-and-publication-of-a-creed-is-a-tribute-to-truth-and-candour-which-every-christian-church-owes-to-the-other-churches-and-to-the-world-around-her.
another-argument-in-favour-of-creeds-publicly-adopted-and-maintained-is-that-they-are-friendly-to-the-study-of-christian-doctrine-and-of-course-to-the-prevalence-of-christian-knowledge.
it-is-an-argument-of-no-small-weight-in-favour-of-creeds-that-the-experience-of-all-ages-has-found-them-indispensably-necessary.
a-further-argument-in-favour-of-creeds-and-confessions-may-be-drawn-from-the-remarkable-fact-that-their-most-zealous-opposers-have-generally-been-latitudinarians-and-heretics.
the-only-further-argument-in-support-of-creeds-on-which-i-shall-dwell-is-that-their-most-zealous-opposers-do-themselves-virtually-employ-them-in-all-ecclesiastical-proceedings.
ii.-examine-some-of-the-principal-objections-which-have-been-made-to-creeds-by-their-adversaries.
and-the-first-which-i-shall-mention-is-that-forming-a-creedand-requiring-subscription-to-it-as-a-religious-test-is-superseding-the-bible-and-making-a-human-composition-instead-of-it-a-standard-of-faith.-the-bible-say-those-who-urge-this-objection-is-the-only-infallible-rule-of-faith-and-practice.-it-is-so-complete-that-it-needs-no-human-addition-and-so-easily-understood-that-it-requires-no-human-explanation.-why-then-should-we-desire-any-other-ecclesiastical-standard-why-subscribe-ourselves-or-call-upon-others-to-subscribe-any-other-creed-than-this-plain-inspired-and-perfect-one-every-time-we-do-this-we-offer-a-public-indignity-to-the-sacred-volume-as-we-virtually-declare-either-that-it-is-not-infallible-or-not-sufficient.
another-objection-frequently-made-to-church-creeds-is-that-they-interfere-with-the-rights-of-conscience-and-naturally-lead-to-oppression.-what-right-say-those-who-urge-this-objection-has-any-church-or-body-of-churches-to-impose-a-creed-on-me-or-dictate-to-me-what-i-shall-believe-to-attempt-such-dictation-is-tyranny-to-submit-to-it-is-to-surrender-the-right-of-private-judgment.
a-third-objection-often-urged-against-subscription-to-creeds-and-confessions-isthat-it-is-unfriendly-to-free-inquiry.-when-a-man-say-the-enemies-of-creeds-has-once-subscribed-a-public-formulary-and-taken-his-ecclesiastical-stand-with-a-church-which-requires-it-he-must-continue-so-to-believe-to-the-end-of-life-or-resign-his-place-new-light-in-abundance-may-offer-itself-to-his-view-but-he-must-close-his-eyes-against-it.-now-can-it-be-right-say-they-for-any-one-voluntarily-to-place-himself-in-circumstances-of-so-much-temptation-willingly-to-place-himself-within-the-reach-of-strong-inducements-to-tamper-with-conscience-and-to-resist-conviction
a-fourth-objection-frequently-brought-against-creeds-is-that-they-have-altogether-failed-of-answering-the-purpose-professed-to-be-intended-by-them.-churches-it-is-said-which-have-creeds-the-most-carefully-drawn-and-of-the-most-rigid-character-are-as-far-from-being-united-in-doctrinal-opinions-as-some-which-either-have-never-had-any-creeds-at-all-or-have-long-since-professedly-omitted-to-enforce-subscription-to-them.-to-mention-only-two-examples-the-church-of-england-for-nearly-three-centuries-has-had-a-set-of-articles-decisively-calvinistic-to-which-all-her-candidates-for-the-ministry-are-required-to-subscribe-but-we-know-that-more-than-a-hundred-and-fifty-years-have-passed-away-since-pelagian-and-semi-pelagian-tenets-began-to-pollute-that-important-branch-of-the-reformed-church-and-that-within-the-last-seventy-five-or-eighty-years-almost-every-form-of-heresy-has-lurked-under-subscription-to-her-orthodox-articles.-and-even-the-church-of-scotland-which-has-had-for-nearly-two-centuries-the-most-rigidly-and-minutely-orthodox-confession-on-earth-is-generally-supposed-at-this-hour-to-have-a-ministry-far-from-being-unanimous-in-loving-and-honouring-her-public-standards.-now-if-creeds-have-not-in-fact-been-productive-of-the-great-benefit-intended-by-them-even-in-some-of-the-most-favourable-cases-that-can-be-produced-why-be-perplexed-and-burdened-with-them-at-all
the-last-objection-which-i-shall-consider-is-that-subscription-to-creeds-has-not-only-failed-entirely-of-producing-the-benefits-con-templated-by-their-friends-but-has-rather-been-found-to-produce-the-opposite-evilsto-generate-discord-and-strife.-creeds-say-some-instead-of-tending-to-compose-differences-and-to-bind-the-members-of-churches-more-closely-together-have-rather-proved-a-bone-of-contention-and-a-means-of-exciting-mutual-charges-of-heresy-and-a-thousand-ill-feelings-among-those-who-might-have-been-otherwise-perfectly-harmonious.
from-the-representation-which-has-been-given-we-may-see-how-little-reason-any-have-to-be-afraid-of-creeds-as-instruments-of-oppression.
we-may-see-from-what-has-been-said-that-subscribing-a-church-creed-is-not-a-mere-formality-but-a-very-solemn-transaction-which-means-much-and-infers-the-most-serious-obligations.-it-is-certainly-a-transaction-which-ought-to-be-entered-upon-with-much-deep-deliberation-and-humble-prayer-and-in-which-if-a-man-be-bound-to-be-sincere-in-anything-he-is-bound-to-be-honest-to-his-god-honest-to-himself-and-honest-to-the-church-which-he-joins.-for-myself-i-know-of-no-transaction-in-which-insincerity-is-more-justly-chargeable-with-the-dreadful-sin-of-lying-to-the-holy-ghost-than-in-this.-it-is-truly-humiliating-and-distressing-to-know-that-in-some-churches-it-has-gradually-become-customary-to-consider-articles-of-faith-as-merely-articles-of-peace-in-other-words-as-articles-which-he-who-subscribes-is-not-considered-as-professing-to-believe-but-as-merely-engaging-not-to-opposeat-least-in-any-public-or-offensive-manner.-whether-we-bring-this-principle-to-the-test-of-reason-of-scripture-of-the-original-design-of-creeds-or-of-the-ordinary-import-of-language-among-honourable-men-it-seems-equally-liable-to-the-severest-reprobation-as-disreputable-and-criminal-in-a-very-high-degree.-nor-does-it-appear-to-me-to-be-any-alleviation-either-of-the-disgrace-or-the-sin-that-many-of-the-governors-of-the-churches-referred-to-as-well-as-of-those-who-subscribe-publicly-avow-their-adoption-of-this-principle-admit-the-correctness-of-it-keep-each-other-in-countenance-and-thus-escape-as-they-imagine-the-charge-of-hypocrisy.-what-would-be-thought-of-a-similar-principle-if-generally-adopted-and-avowed-with-respect-to-the-administration-of-oaths-in-civil-courts-suppose-both-jurors-and-witnesses-feeling-it-a-grievance-to-be-bound-by-their-oaths-to-speak-the-truth-were-to-agree-among-themselves-and-openly-to-give-out-that-they-did-not-mean-when-they-swore-to-take-on-themselves-any-such-obligation-that-they-did-not-so-understand-the-import-of-their-oaths-and-did-not-intend-to-recognize-any-such-meaning-and-suppose-the-judges-were-freely-to-admit-them-to-their-oaths-with-a-similar-understanding-would-a-witness-or-a-juror-in-such-a-case-be-exempt-from-the-charge-of-perjury-or-the-judge-from-the-guilt-of-subornation-of-perjury-i-presume-not-in-the-estimation-of-any-sober-minded-man.-if-it-were-otherwise-then-bad-men-who-form-a-majority-of-every-community-might-by-combining-violate-all-the-principles-of-virtue-and-order-not-only-with-impunity-but-also-without-sin.
from-the-view-which-has-been-presented-of-this-subject-we-may-decide-how-an-honest-man-ought-to-act-after-subscribing-to-a-public-creed.-he-will-feel-it-to-be-his-duty-to-adhere-sincerely-and-faithfully-to-that-creed-in-public-and-in-private-and-to-make-it-his-study-to-promote-by-all-means-in-his-power-the-peace-and-purity-of-the-body-with-which-he-has-connected-himself.-and-if-he-should-at-any-time-alter-his-views-concerning-any-part-of-the-creed-or-order-of-the-church-in-question-it-will-be-incumbent-on-him-to-inquire-whether-the-points-concerning-which-he-has-altered-his-mind-are-of-such-a-nature-as-that-he-can-conscientiously-be-silent-concerning-them-and-give-no-offence-to-the-body-to-which-he-belongs.-if-he-can-reconcile-this-with-an-enlightened-sense-of-duty-he-may-remain-in-peace.-but-if-the-points-concerning-which-his-views-have-undergone-a-change-are-of-so-much-importance-in-his-estimation-as-that-he-cannot-be-silent-but-must-feel-himself-bound-to-publish-and-endeavour-to-propagate-them-then-let-him-peaceably-withdraw-and-join-some-other-branch-of-the-visible-church-with-which-he-can-walk-harmoniously.-such-he-may-find-almost-every-where-unless-his-views-be-singularly-eccentric.-but-at-any-rate-he-has-no-more-right-to-insist-on-remaining-and-being-permitted-publicly-to-oppose-what-he-has-solemnly-vowed-to-receive-and-support-than-a-member-of-any-voluntary-association-which-he-entered-under-certain-engagements-but-with-which-he-no-longer-agrees-has-a-right-obstinately-to-retain-his-connexion-with-it-and-to-avail-himself-of-the-influence-which-his-connexion-gives-him-to-endeavour-to-tear-it-in-pieces.
